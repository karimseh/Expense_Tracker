# React Tutorial - Expense Tracker
 
 I learned about react Hooks ( useState , useReducer, useContext, useEffect), and the Context API which allows us to centralize the State so it can be acessible by all children components.

 # About the App:
 It is a simple Expense Tracker, the user can 'CREATE' a Transaction, 'DELETE' a Transaction, 'READ' Transactions.


# What i added :
I added a simple localStorage so the transactions could be saved after page refresh.
